    <h3>The story</h3>
    <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q>Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q>Maybe.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q>Maybe.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q>Maybe.</q><p/>

    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong>  — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good"> good</strong> fortune.

<p>Conclusion
    <strong>  Good</strong> and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are<strong> good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong>good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
